=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Net::DNS;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

DNS DELEG resource record

The DELEG record appears in, and is logically a part of,
the parent zone to mark the delegation point for a child zone.
It advertises, directly or indirectly, transport methods
available for connection to nameservers serving the child zone.

The DELEG class is derived from, and inherits all properties of,
the Net::DNS::RR::SVCB class.

Please see the L<Net::DNS::RR::SVCB> documentation for details.

=head1 METHODS

The available methods are those inherited from the base class augmented
by the type-specific methods defined in this package.

Use of undocumented package features or direct access to internal data
structures is discouraged and could result in program termination or
other unpredictable behaviour.
